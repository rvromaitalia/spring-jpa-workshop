Part 1: Setup
Initialize a new Spring Boot project with the following required dependencies:

Spring Web
Spring Data JPA
MySQL Driver
H2 Database (for testing)
Lombok
Make sure you have created a database in MySQL. 

Configure your MySQL DataSource with the application.properties file.

Change the H2 dependency scope in pom.xml from <scope>runtime</scope> to <scope>test</scope>.

Create a resources directory inside the test directory.
(This should appear as a suggestion when you right-click the test folder.)

Configure your H2 database with an application.properties file inside the resources folder under the test directory.
(This property file will override the main one for your tests.)

Verify that your application starts without errors.

Commit your changes to Git and push them to GitHub.
Notify the instructor by sharing a link to your repository.
